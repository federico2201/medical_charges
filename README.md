# medical_charges
Task: predict customer healthcare costs using machine learning. Develop a regression model using the insurance.csv dataset to predict charges. Evaluate the model's accuracy using the R-Squared Score. Then, apply the model to estimate predicted_charges for unseen data in validation_dataset.csv. R squared score equal to or larger than 0.65 is considered acceptable.
